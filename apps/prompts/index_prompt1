Example:
# [Title of the Project]
[A brief description of the project and its purpose]

## Project Pages
-  [Wiki Page Title]([wiki_link_relative_to_repository]) - [A brief description of the wiki page]

### Some Sections (If applicable)
- [Wiki Page Title]([wiki_link_relative_to_repository]) - [A brief description of the wiki page]
...
